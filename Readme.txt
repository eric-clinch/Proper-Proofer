Proper Proofer teaches users about propositional logic, allows users to build logically valid 
natural deduction proofs, and can automatically generate its own natural deduction proofs of 
propositional statements using classical logic.

Proper Proofer can be run as a normal python script. It does not use any third pary libraries
or any files external to the program. The only modules used by the program are time, copy, and
tkinter.
